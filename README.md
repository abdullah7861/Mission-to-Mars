# Mission to Mars 
## Background
A web scraping application which retrieves and presents summary information, the latest news, and images of Mars. A project designed to loads the data into MongoDB and displays the information in a single HTML page. 

### Process:
Scrape data from several websites containing Mars news. Different types of data included were images of Mars, tweets about the current Mars weather, a table of Mars facts, and headlines with the latest Mars news. After scraping, the data is stored in MongoDB and then loaded it into an HTML file using a Flask template that interfaces with Python and formatted with HTML using Bootstrap.

### Steps:
- To scrape various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and display output on Jupyter Notebook [Scraping_mission_to_mars.ipynb]
- To create a Python Script [scrape_mars.py] to scrape and execute all scraping code and return one Python dictionary containing all of the scraped data
- To create a Flask App [app.py] to create route (index and scrape). The root route / will query Mongo database and pass the mars data into an HTML template to display the data
- To create HTML file [index.html] that will take the mars data dictionary and display all of the data in the appropriate HTML elements
- To create Mongo db and collection to store the scraped data. PyMongo was used to set up mongo connection and to define db and collection

### Prerequisites
- The Python libraries flask, flask_pymongo, BeautifulSoup, and splinter must be installed in order for the code to run. The initial data scraping can be run either in a Jupyter Notebook or in Python

### Technology Stack 
- HTML, CSS, BootStrap, Jupyter, Python
- Python Libraries - Pandas, Beautiful Soup, Splinter, PyMongo
- Database - Mongo DB
- App Server - Flask

### Sources:
- [Nasa Mars News](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/)
Scrape the latest NASA Mars news using BeautifulSoup, splinter, pandas in a jupyter notebook.
- [JPL Space Images](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/?search=&category=Mars)
Using Splinter to navigate the site and scrape the JPL featured image of mars in full resolution.
- [Mars Weather Twitter](https://twitter.com/marswxreport?lang=en)
Visit the Mars Weather Twitter account and scrape the latest Mars weather data.
- [Space Facts](https://space-facts.com/mars/) 
Mars facts table from Space-Facts.
- [USGS](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars)
From United States Geological Survey Astrogeology to obtain high resulution images for each of Mar's Hemisphere. 

### Run without Heroku:
- Copy/gather the files in this repo (don't need the .gitignore)
- Start a MongoDB daemon in the terminal, then start mongo instance
- Run the app.py in the terminal. Copy the local url to your web browser
